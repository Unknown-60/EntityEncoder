### About

**Entity Encoder** is a lightweight and open source application for Android which allows and is intended to encode ASCII texts to entities, or vice versa.  Its use can and is varied, from professionalism, cryptographic (either to encode your Scripts/programs, your website), or for CTF hacking competitions.

I didn't find a similar application or software, I needed to have this type of tools within my reach, so I thought about developing it, and why not, making it public, free and open source.

<p><b>ASCII text:</b></p>
<code>Hello world!</code>
<p><br /><b>Conversion to entities:</b></p>
<code>\0x48\0x65\0x6c\0x6c\0x6f\0x20\0x77\0x6f\0x72\0x6c\0x64\0x21</code>

### Characteristics
- <b>light</b>: It doesn't use too many resources and avoided using too many vectors to conserve size and improve performance.<br /><br />
- <b>Secure</b>: It does not require permissions.<br /><br />
- <b>Own</b>: The use of unnecessary dependencies or libraries was avoided for not waste memory at execution time.
